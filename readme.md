### Async Weather Application

Weather application which collects geolocation from the Google maps API.<br/>
Once the geolocation has been collected it is forwarded to Forecast.io in the form of a lattitude and longitude. The result of that will be a general summary of the weather that day, a current temperature and a weekly summary.

## Example commands

node app.js -address "Hull"
node app.js -a "Hull"
